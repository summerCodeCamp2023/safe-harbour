If these potentials are well utilized, cultism is no longer see the light of day in our society.

<h5 class="center-align  brown-text text-darken-3">FINAL ADVICE TO STUDENTS AND OTHER YOUTHS</h5>
<P class="justify"> As a Student, out of your total (100%) success on campus 60% depends on your personal effort and commitment, 20% depends  on your parents and 20% on the governing authorities. you will agree with me that many minded student succeed within and outside the country, with or without perantal/governmental care. Parental and governmental are important but your personal effort and determination matters most. </P>
<h6> PARENTS, DON'T BE CARELESS!!!</h6>
<p>The big boy or big girl fallacy This is the wrong assumption by parents that a child in the tertiary institution is big enough and need not to be guided. youth in higher institution need counselling by their parents or guidian. Parent and guidian should pay impromptu visit to their children and ward in school to check and curtail their excesses.</p>
<p> Unfortunately, when children of wealthy parents are sent out of nigeria school for commiting crime they often send such children to schools in Bitain or America."Year 2007 survey by UNICEF proovs that these two countries are the worst advance countries for youth to grow up" Apart from the fact that survey shows them to be 'down of the class' (lowest) in academics performance the level of gangesterism is high. It is not the amount of money spent that determines the quality of children's future but you must add qualitative amoungt of Godly knowledge, time and Prayers to properly mode your children at your model heirs.</p>
