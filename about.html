        <ol>
            <li>Untimely Death
                One of the pathetic effects of cultism is the loss of lives prematurely. The government through its law enforcement agencies on a constant effort, fights crime such as armed robbery, kidnapping, drug abuse, murder etc. carried out by the cult members.The outcome of such operations often results in exchange of fire, arrest, detention, imprisonment and death. Many young people who indulge in these heinous acts have lost their lives either in the course of a shootout confrontation or through inter-cult clashes.
                 </li>
                 <li> Loss of Moral Values
                    Cultism leads to loss of values in young people. This is because the belief system and ideologies of most of these cult groups are against the objective morality of life.
                    </li>
                 <li>Incomplete Education
                    Most cultists end up not completing their academic programme. Today, school authorities in a bid to curb the rate of cultism and its activities, have adopted strict penalties for it which include expulsion of students involved irrespective of the academic level they are.
                    </li>
                 <li> Drug and substance Addiction
                    Furthermore, drug addiction can be as a result of influence of cultism among our youths. Within the circle of fellow cult members, they are constantly exposed to drugs through the network of dealers on such substances who are regularly patronized by these cultists.
                    </li>
                 <li>Unrealizable Life Ambitions
                    Also cultism can lead to termination of ambitions and goals in youths. Most young people with bright future and potentials, end up not pursuing their career or goals because of the negative influence of cultism.
